## Usage

After installation, you can start the server by running:

```bash
./yokai-mcp-template
```

You can configure the server by modifying the configuration files in the `config` directory. Make sure to review the available options to customize your setup.

## Directory Structure

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the directory structure:

```
yokai-mcp-template/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ module1/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ module2/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.sum
```

- **cmd/**: Contains the entry point for the application.
- **config/**: Configuration files for the server.
- **internal/**: Modules and internal logic for your application.

## Configuration

The configuration file is located in the `config` directory. Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
logging:
  level: info
```

Adjust the settings according to your requirements. You can specify the server port, logging level, and other parameters.

## Observability

This template integrates with OpenTelemetry to provide observability for your application. To enable observability:

1. Install the OpenTelemetry Go SDK:
   ```bash
   go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel
   ```

2. Configure the OpenTelemetry settings in your application.

For more details, refer to the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/go/).
